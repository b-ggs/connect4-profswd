# profswd-connect4

Connect4 project created for PROFSWD S18 under Mr. Maynard Landrito and Mr. Art Caronongan.

This implementation contains three modes:
- Player vs. Player, where two people can take turns to drop tokens.
- Player vs. Computer, where one person can take on an AI, and
- Computer vs. Computer, where two AIs attempt to beat each other in the game.

This was implemented using:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- JQuery (https://jquery.com/)
- Ruby on Rails (http://rubyonrails.org)
